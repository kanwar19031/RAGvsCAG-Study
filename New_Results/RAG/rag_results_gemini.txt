explain\nComply or explain is a regulatory approach used in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries in the field of corporate governance and financial supervision.\n Rather than setting out binding laws, government regulators (in the UK, the Financial Reporting Council, in Germany, under the Aktiengesetz) set out a code, which listed companies may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain publicly why they do not.\n The UK Corporate Governance Code, the German Corporate Governance Code (or Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 'Code Tabaksblat' () use this approach in setting minimum standards for companies in their audit committees, remuneration committees and recommendations for how good companies should divide authority on their boards.\nTitle: Mercedes-Benz short bonnet trucks\nThe Mercedes-Benz \"Kurzhauber\" (short-bonnet) truck is a conventional layout, cab-after-engine truck manufactured from

Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations regarding unlicensed transmissions.\nWith some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance and statutory requirements, which engages in \"actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law\".\n The binary choice between 'complying' with the law and 'going beyond' the law must be qualified with some nuance.\n In many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers can choose to comply with the law, to go beyond the law, but they can also choose to not comply with the law, such as when they deliberately ignore gender equality or the mandate to hire disabled workers.\n There must be a recognition that many so-called 'hard' laws are also 'weak' laws, weak in the sense that they are poorly enforced, with no or little control or no or few sanctions in case of non-compliance.\n 'Weak' law must not be confused with soft law.\n The aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions.\n CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.\nTitle:

coming from \"distant\" sources.\n The limit is , or about 8\u00a0joules.\n The limit is set by slowing-interactions of cosmic ray protons with the microwave background radiation over long distances (~160 million light-years).\n The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected.\n For example, one extreme-energy cosmic ray has been detected which appeared to possess a record (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 60\u00a0mph baseball).\n\nQuestion: What does the Hacker-Pschorr Brewery have
