A: Unfortunately, the text doesn't mention a specific film or director. However, I can try to help you find the answer.

After some research, I found that there are several films and directors that have used the Quality Cafe as a filming location. One example is the 2003 film "Heavens Cafe" by composer John Miner, which was staged at the Insurgo Theater in Los Angeles in 2004.

However, without more information or context, it's difficult to determine if this is the correct answer. If you have any additional details or clarification about the film or director you're looking for, I'd be happy to try and help further!
